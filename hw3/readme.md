1. Create a symbolic link to 'dataset'
2. The main file is 'main_rnn_with_seq_len_128.py' file
3. 'loss_curve.py' is for plotting validation accuracy and validation loss graph
4. 'export/rnn_only_frame_do_early_stop' directory contains the final model of mine that gives the best result
(This corresponds to experiment 'f' from the report paper)
5. Report file is 'HW3_sunghee_jung.pdf'
